# hgexample

Hashgraph implementation in Clojure

Only basic functionality is implemented and networking, despite existing code, is not
ready yet.

Tests containing up until the base example given in the additional material
to Swirlds original whitepaper pass.

## Usage

You won't be able to do much except play with the functions on a REPL

```
lein with-profile +dev repl
```

And pass the tests

```
lein test
```
